# bomb-lab
This is the Bomb Lab, taken from "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective".
http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/2e/labs.html

I've recreated this C code from disassembly of the binary file, just as an exercice to prove understanding of the lab.
I do not own the lab, so if you want to modify it please ask the original authors for permission.
